Substantial refactoring and simplification around the BinarySensor classes and subclasses. Support for 'room_sensor' and 'temperature_sensor' were removed since there is no evidence they were ever needed. Only 'lm' sensors are considered multi-sensors (with temperature and humidity). It's conceivable these changes will break some existing cases. Please report any issues.
